✅ CAPTCHA Types Categorized by Automation Difficulty
🟢 Level 1: Feasible to Automate (Basic – Can Be Implemented Easily)
1. Simple Text-based CAPTCHAs
Example: 5 distorted letters/numbers in an image
Ease: ✅ Easy to automate

🔍 Why Automatable:
Static image input

Simple distortions (removable via OpenCV)

No behavioral or timing checks

Same structure each time

🛠️ How:
Use OpenCV for image preprocessing (binarization, thresholding)

OCR with Tesseract or train a CNN (if OCR fails)

High success rate after image cleanup

🚧 Limitations:
Becomes harder if characters overlap heavily

May fail if CAPTCHAs rotate characters randomly or use too many fonts

🟡 Level 2: Moderately Hard (Can Be Done With Effort)
2. Advanced Text CAPTCHAs with Noise, Rotation, Overlap
Example: Warped and overlapping characters
Ease: ⚠️ Moderate effort

🔍 Why Harder:
Noise and rotation confuse OCR

Font randomization, overlapping letters reduce accuracy

Image filters needed for noise and blur removal

🛠️ How:
Train custom deep learning model on a CAPTCHA dataset

Use advanced image filters (adaptive thresholding, dilation)

Manual CAPTCHA labeling may be required

3. Honeypot CAPTCHAs (Hidden Fields)
Example: Invisible form fields or bot traps
Ease: ✅ Technically easy, but needs awareness

🔍 Why Automatable:
Simply don't interact with hidden inputs

Can detect trap fields via HTML/CSS parsing (display: none, aria-hidden, etc.)

🛠️ How:
Avoid form fields with suspicious names or hidden styles

Simulate human typing delay

🔴 Level 3: Very Hard (Advanced – Needs AI/3rd-Party Help)
4. Image-based CAPTCHAs (Object Recognition)
Example: “Click all images with buses”
Ease: 🔴 Difficult

🔍 Why Difficult:
Dynamic images loaded from server

Requires object detection in each tile

Sometimes new tiles appear after each click

🛠️ Partial Automation:
Use object detection models (e.g., YOLOv5)

Need labeled datasets for accuracy

Or send images to a CAPTCHA-solving service

🚧 Limitations:
Detection fails with poor-quality or cropped images

High compute cost for real-time inference

5. Google ReCAPTCHA v2 ("I'm not a robot")
Ease: 🔴 Very difficult

🔍 Why Difficult:
Tracks mouse movement, timing, browser fingerprint

If suspicious, triggers image CAPTCHA (see above)

Invisible verification via token

🛠️ Workarounds:
Use puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth or Selenium stealth plugins

Requires human-like behavior emulation

Still prone to fail or get rate-limited

⚠️ Best Option:
Use 2Captcha or AntiCaptcha (returns token from human solvers)

🔴🔴 Level 4: Extremely Difficult (Not Practical for Solo Implementation)
6. Google ReCAPTCHA v3 (Score-based, Invisible)
Ease: 🔴🔴 Extremely difficult

🔍 Why Nearly Impossible:
No visible challenge, no UI to hack

Server determines if you're a bot based on:

Interaction patterns

Device fingerprinting

IP history, cookies, referrer, etc.

No clear way to “solve” it

🛠️ Theoretical Workarounds:
Use clean browser profile with Puppeteer

Emulate natural user behavior (mouse path, clicks, scrolls)

Inject legit ReCAPTCHA token using a third-party solver

🚧 Limitations:
May require constant IP rotation, behavioral mimicry

Google continually updates heuristics

| Image-based CAPTCHAs          | 🔴 Hard      | ⚠️ AI + Detection needed        | Object recognition, dynamic image loading |
| ReCAPTCHA v2                  | 🔴 Hard      | ⚠️ Stealth + Behavior emulation | Mouse paths, fingerprint, timing          |
| ReCAPTCHA v3 (Score-based)    | 🔴🔴 Extreme | ❌ Only with token APIs          | No interaction, behavior-only detection   |
